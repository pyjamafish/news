Creative Portion:
- We create a profile page where you can see a brief bio on the user.
  - You can edit your own bio as well as view others' bios.
  - The bio is stored as a field in 'users'.
- We also made an upvote/downvote system where there is a 'score' field for each post.
  - Users that are logged in are able to upvote and downvote posts however many times they want.
- You can mention users in the comments with @username, and it will automatically be converted to a link to that user's page.
